# What I Learned

I've worked with datetime before, but it is by no means a module I've memorized or internalized. I am looking forward to learning more here. (Or at least cementing some concepts)

## Base Problem



My first inclination was to use the Calendar module. Its method itermonthdays4 seems to return exactly what we need - a datetime.date object. However, after playing with that for about half an hour, I couldn't quite get it to do what I needed. After that I decided to start off with a naive attempt at the problem to see if a better solution presented itself.

So, interestingly, Trey says it will be tricky with just datetime, but I found it SO MUCH easier than what I was trying to do with calendar. I'll be VERY interested in seeing what his solution is!
