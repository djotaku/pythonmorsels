# What I Learned

## Base Problem

[Base Solution](https://github.com/djotaku/pythonmorsels/blob/1cbdf7d17e79f1655c59b8bb5595246c89f32bdb/parse_ranges/parse_ranges.py)

As I mentioned in the commit, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to use list comprehension, but I couldn't figure how how to refer to the first list I had to make. (When I did the '-' split). Pretty neat that it also automatically worked for Bonus 2. I think of all the problems I've done for Python Morsels, this is the first time I've been completely convinced I was doing this the worst possible way. If he DOES mention how to do this with list comprehensions, I'd like to see what I was doing wrong.

## Bonus 1

I think I had a solution that would work for Bonus 1, but the problem is that his unit test has an assertion from 100-1000000000000 and that was killing the computer. It's important to note that I ended up with Solutions Prime and Bonus 2 at once. Then Bonus 3 before I came back to Bonus 1. Essentially, if I could solve the list comprehension, then I could turn it into a generator and it would work - and should work for all solutions. 

## Bonus 2

Hurray, this just happened to work when I did the Base Problem solution.

## Bonus 3

There's no way I did this the way it's supposed to be done, but I wanted to see what I could do without using the hints. I can't wait to see how this is supposed to actually be solved.
