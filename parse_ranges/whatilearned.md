# What I Learned

## Base Problem

As I mentioned in the commit, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to use list comprehension, but I couldn't figure how how to refer to the first list I had to make. (When I did the '-' split). Pretty neat that it also automatically worked for Bonus 2. I think of all the problems I've done for Python Morsels, this is the first time I've been completely convinced I was doing this the worst possible way. If he DOES mention how to do this with list comprehensions, I'd like to see what I was doing wrong.

## Bonus 2

Hurray, this just happened to work when I did the Base Problem solution.
