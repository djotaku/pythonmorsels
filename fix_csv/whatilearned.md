I'm already familiar with the csv module and the argparse module. But that doesn't mean I'm a pro. Let's see what I learned:

# Base Solution

As I thought, the base solution was incredibly easy for me. I'd already done similar things in different projects. [My Amortization package](https://github.com/djotaku/amortization) makes use of CSV. And [lastfmwtitter](https://pypi.org/project/lastfmtwitter/) makes use of argparse. Now, I don't use either package regularly enough to just solve this off the top of my head, but I was able to quickly review my other projects to remind me of what to do. Also, because of my various projects I've gotten VERY good at reading the Python documentation and a huge chunk of the base problem is easily solved by grokking [The Python CSV documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
