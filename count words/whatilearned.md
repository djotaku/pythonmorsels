# What I learned

## Base Solution

So, for this one, I had done something similar in Impractical Python. I didn't actually end up committing the solution that contained what I needed, but I knew it was in collections. So, as Trey said, I didn't got to Google or Stack Exchange. I just looked in the Python docs for collections, since I knew it was there. Actually, at first I thought maybe itertools? Like iterate and accumulate. But accumulate is something else.

Then, once I had the right package, my first attempt at the solution actually broke out the sentence into letters. I wanted WORDS. But I've been doing Python for a long time, so I knew about split. Once I had that, it was easy to get the base solution.
