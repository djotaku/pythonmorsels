# What I learned

## Base Solution

So, for this one, I had done something similar in Impractical Python. I didn't actually end up committing the solution that contained what I needed, but I knew it was in collections. So, as Trey said, I didn't got to Google or Stack Exchange. I just looked in the Python docs for collections, since I knew it was there. Actually, at first I thought maybe itertools? Like iterate and accumulate. But accumulate is something else.

Then, once I had the right package, my first attempt at the solution actually broke out the sentence into letters. I wanted WORDS. But I've been doing Python for a long time, so I knew about split. Once I had that, it was easy to get the base solution. 

## Bonus 1

Once again, I knew about lower. But I was pleasantly surprised that I could chain that with split rather than have to update the variable twice.

## Bonus 2

My initial guess was that Bonus 2 would probably hinge around regular expressions. But I clicked on the hint link to see if there was some cool built-in function of strings. Turns out I was right! I was having issues with it splitting up "don't" So I had to setup the regular expression to only look for special characters at the beginning and end of a word. The solution I came up with took me a while to get the regular expression working. It's definitely not elegant, so I'm very curious to see what his solution ends up being.
