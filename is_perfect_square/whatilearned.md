# What I Learned

## Base Problem

Trey began his problem statement this way: "This week I want you to write a function that might seem simple at first, but there's a number of ways to solve it." It definitely took some out of the box thinking for me to figure out how I was going to solve the base case. The math.sqrt() function returns a float so that it can give answers for non-perfect squares. So I kept thinking and I realized that any perfect, non-complex square root must be an integer. So I came up with the conditional to return. (And after all this Pythonic learning, I've learned not to evaluate for truth and then return a variable. Just return the evaluation)
