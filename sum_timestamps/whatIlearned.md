# What I learned

## Base Problem

[My Solution to the Base Problem](https://github.com/djotaku/pythonmorsels/blob/d083f27e1d1b521b10261bb891d1afd9e75eaf3b/sum_timestamps/sum_timestamps.py)

Boy, oh boy. This could have been SOOOO useful when I was compiling playtimes for my End of Year video game blog post. I will definitely be repurposing this code!

This part wasn't too hard. I'm pretty sure the fact that I loop twice means I didn't choose the most efficient way to do this, although I'm proud of my list comprehension up front. I'm guessing the absolute easiest (and maybe most elegant?) way to do this probably involves importing datetime and having that do the math for you. I'm curious to see what Trey does for this answer.


## Bonus 1



For this part, the fact that I have to check for 60 twice makes me thing I should refactor that out to a function. I did so and it made things pretty easy. Again, if you look at my code, it's starting to get a bit messy. I'm very sure at this point that Trey is going to have a much cleaner solution.
