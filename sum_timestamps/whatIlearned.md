# What I learned

## Base Problem



Boy, oh boy. This could have been SOOOO useful when I was compiling playtimes for my End of Year video game blog post. I will definitely be repurposing this code!

This part wasn't too hard. I'm pretty sure the fact that I loop twice means I didn't choose the most efficient way to do this, although I'm proud of my list comprehension up front. I'm guessing the absolute easiest (and maybe most elegant?) way to do this probably involves importing datetime and having that do the math for you. I'm curious to see what Trey does for this answer.
