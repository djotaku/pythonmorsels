# What I learned

## Base Problem

This wasn't too hard for me as I knew about slices. Now, I don't often slice from the back, so I had to play around a little in the REPL to confirm I had the right syntax.

## From Bonus 1

As part of dealing with the 0 constraint, I ended up solving Bonus 1. I wonder if I'll discover a more elegant solution to the base when Trey sends out the solutions email.

## From Bonus 2

I learned about deques. They're really neat lists where you can limit the max size of it and it automatically throws away items as it fills.
