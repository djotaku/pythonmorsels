# What I Learned

## Base Problem
I believe I could easily implement a generator function by going back through my notes from previous Python Morsels exercises (the first time I truly learned about, and how to use, generators). And if I were implementing this on my own, I think I know how I'd do it as a class - I'd use yields instead of returns. But I'm not sure how I'd create a class that just works the way Trey asks things to work - not calling any functions, just returning values. Maybe by implementing a return in the init? So I decided to check the callables hint he has listed. Following that link, I learned that a callable is essentially anything we call with parenthesis is a callable - including functions, classes, class methods, and instances of classes. Ah, midway through the page I found out that what I need to make a class callable is to add a dunder call method.
