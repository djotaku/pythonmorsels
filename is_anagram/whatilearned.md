# What I Learned

## Base Solution

Things got off to a bad start when I accidentally confused anagrams with palindromes. (Mostly because the first example almost looks like a palindrome). Wasted about an hour on that, but I did get a better understanding of various string and list functions. Once I realized it was anagrams we were after, it was pretty easy to realize you just wanted to use sets and do comparison. Unlike a list, sets don't care about order, just membership. Of course, that also meant I had to check for length as the skin, sinks test was there to remind us.
