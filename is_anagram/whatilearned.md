Things got off to a bad start when I accidentally confused anagrams with palindromes. (Mostly because the first example almost looks like a palindrome). Wasted about an hour on that, but I did get a better understanding of various string and list functions. Once I realized it was anagrams we were after, it was pretty easy to realize you just wanted to use sets and do comparison. Unlike a list, sets don't care about order, just membership. Of course, that also meant I had to check for length as the skin, sinks test was there to remind us.

This one wasn't too tough using replace. However, looking ahead to Bonus 2, I'm thinking regular expressions are going to be needed to keep things from getting ridiculous.
