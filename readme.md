# My Solutions to Python Morsels

[Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com]) is a really neat website that sends you a problem to solve in Python each week. It has a built-in Python interpreter and creator Trey Hunner also provides you with a unit test file you can use to test your solutions.

Here's how I want to use this repo:

- There will be one folder per exercise that I do. 
- Each folder will have a readme describing the problem I was given
- In there you can look at my commits. There will be a commit for each step I am able to do - base solution, Bonus 1, 2, etc. The description of my commit will contain my thoughts.
- If I learn anything neat from Trey's official solution, I will note that as well.
- I will summarize what I learned from my commits and Trey's solution in whatilearned.md.
