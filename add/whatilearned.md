This was a VERY tough one for me. I thought I understood List Comprehensions, but I knew about as much as John Snow.

Intuitively I knew I had to use multiple assignment, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work. Then I was looking through my Python notes on my wiki and I saw that when I had been reading *Serious Python*, I noted that I should learn zip because it was neat. So that let me know what I could use zip to get tuples out from iterables. It's usually used to make Dictionaries so that helped tip me in the right direction.

So I combined that knowledge with [Trey's List Comprehension](https://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/) page which I'd read earlier in the day.

# Bonus 1

From *Impractical Python* I had a feeling this had to do with asterisks. He'd used it there a couple times although I hadn't internalized it. I also figured, from having seen some code out there, it probably had something to do with Kwargs. But I would have to do some more research to know how to use this within my code.
